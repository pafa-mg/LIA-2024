**I love to learn new skills.** My drive to learn and develop myself has led me to various pursuits, from learning musical instruments to volunteering for my local 'Aktiespararna,' and has even inspired me to start my own company and e-commerce website called Lekalot alongside my regular job. I am not afraid to embrace new challenges and opportunities.

**People would describe me as calm and happy.** While at work, my focus remains on the goal, yet I always make sure to enjoy the journey by having fun and taking in new knowledge along the way.

## So what is my goal?
I want to become a good developer with a solid fullstack knowledge, but I also want to widen my field. As of now, my education is mainly Java but in the future I would want to learn Python and learn about AI and ML.
But my goal right now is to get a LIA where I can get the best experience to help me get started towards my goals.

## This is why MobilityGuard is my preffered place to do LIA
When we talked at the "Arbetsmarknadsdagen" I could hear that you guys love what you do. The friendly and engaging way of how you explained about your company
and what you do and how your products work, really proves that you got experience and knowledge that I would love to learn from. And the products of the company sound really interesting
and it would be fun to learn more about them.

## Why me?
Because you get a student that is highly motivated to become a good developer who also knows the value of communication.

## I am proud of my work
You have probably seen it 1000 times or more, but I have to say that my [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/vonfredd/Tic-Tac-Toe) represents me in a good way.
As a school project the assignment was to make a Tic-tac-toe game with a GUI, and for those who wanted higher grade would implement a server for multiplayer functions.

**I always go for the highest grades** because they always contain the harder problems to solve (which I think would be a requirement in the regular grade because that is what development is about, isn't it??).
I created a server and I "was done" with the assignment, but I wasn't really done. I made a nice GUI of my own choice instead of a regular 9-boxed square to complete the project.
There are :bug::bug: in the application but the point I want to make is that I use the assignments we receive to get the maximum experience from them while also trying to make my own implementations/enhancements to them if I can.
