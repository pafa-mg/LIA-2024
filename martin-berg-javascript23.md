Hi! My name is Martin and im 28 years old. I grew up on the country side just
10 minutes away from Västerås. I would describe myself as a very calm and stable
person with a gentle nature. I am very careful and responsive and have an eye
for details. I also like to be creative. I think others would describe me as
happy and easy going.

In my freetime I spend time with my partner. I'm also music interested and I play
guitar a lot. I would say that playing guitar is my main creative outlet besides
programming. I also make sure to workout at the gym and stay active as well by going
out for long walks.

My goal is to be able to work at a place where I find the job truly interesting,
challenging and fun at the same time.

I think I would be a good fit since I'm keen to learn new things and would like
to think that I bring good spirits to a team.

This project is related to a JavaScript course where we focused on fetching
data from an api. I used an api from 'The Metropolitan Museum of Art' in New York.

Basically they have loads of different data, I think there is around 480k objects
to fetch from. The most fun things to fetch in my opinion is objects that has images
available.

This means that you can fetch art / objects that ranges from 5000 years
back so you can find a lot of cool stuff. I'm proud of this project since it's
my first 'big' project and fetching all the data could be a bit finicky sometimes.
I also think this project really cemented my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript.
Especially since i wanted to implement a function so that you can search for your
own keywords and get results that matches it.

I found I could easily spend 10 minutesjust looking at different images that show up
based on a query. Say I wanted to get a tattoo of a tiger or whatever I could search
for 'tiger' and get inspiration I never know i needed. I also created a memory game
using data from this API.

I would also like to mention this small sideproject I started on the side after
I made this project which is a tic tac toe game. Although it's not done yet the
core functions of the game is more or less done. I'm proud of this one since I
made this game with more or less no help at all from Google or YouTube etc. It's
probably not the best solution but it's doing what I want it to (almost).
