PERSONAL LETTER
My name is Robin Alfengård, I am 30 years old, and I live in Guldheden, Gothenburg. 
I am currently studying java development at IT-Högskolan here in Gothenburg and I’m loving it! Now it’s time to apply for internships, 
and after speaking to you at the career fair event at Akademiska Hus, I got the impression that Mobility Guard is a warm, welcoming and exciting place to work. 
After reading through the introduction sent over github, and after doing some research on your web page my interest grew and I hope to get the opportunity to 
grow as a developer together with you by contributing to your ongoing projects. I am currently looking for internships between 11/11/2024-09/05/2025, but the time period
can be adjusted a bit towards your needs. 

As previously mentioned I am now studying java on IT Högskolan here in Gothenburg. What makes me stand out, is  that I have previously been attending a java bootcamp 
held by Academy, the program gave me lots of java experience and knowledge about object-oriented programming, database management using PostgreSQL, Spring Boot, Spring Security, 
MVC design pattern, and RestAPI, as well as various frontend technologies. The training was very hands-on and involved a lot of programming and group work using 
agile methods such as sprints and daily stand-ups. At the end of the program we worked on a group project which ended up being a spring boot based demo for a web app 
which aimed to help golfers connect with other golfers by matching their skills, location etc. This previous experience has made some of the current education feel 
like repetition which has given me an opportunity to dig deeper into specific fields. It has also given me an opportunity to try some other programming languages, 
which I have done by attending university courses in C# and in Python. I have also been working on hobby projects to enhance my skills in building REST APIs in fullstack 
projects with java and React for the frontend (Some of these are linked below). The construction and maintenance of APIs is what I have been finding to be most fun at the 
current stage in my development career, and I find it very exciting that you want your interns to work with that as described in the information sent over github.

From my previous role as an exhibition producer at Borås Konstmuseum where I worked between 2019-2023, I am accustomed to working on project management with colleagues, 
which requires a great deal of responsibility and good collaboration. I mainly worked on the production of temporary projects, which means I am also accustomed to working 
under time pressure and meeting deadlines, requiring good planning skills and effective communication. I find these skills to complement the collaborative environment at 
Mobility Guard exemplified by your staff at the work fair.

As an individual, I am incredibly curious and always eager to learn something new, as evidenced by my diverse background. I am used to working in teams and find 
it enjoyable to achieve goals together with colleagues. I have a drive and passion in everything I do. If I did not have conviction and ambition to follow my passion, 
I probably would not have dared to switch paths from a workplace where I was content to a future in development, which I am fully convinced is right for me.

Thank you, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my blended background and skills can contribute at Mobility Guard. If you have any further
questions or want me to elaborate on something specific, please contact me! 
Robin Alfengård

PS: I also saw that you are sponsoring BK Häcken, which made me even more excited to join your team ;)

PROJECTS
Link to a book club app built with spring, postgresql and react
https://github.com/robinalfengard/BookClub
This application is built with java to create the backend endpoints which are connected to a postgresql database. The frontend is built with React.
The application was built last year, but is still in demo mode. It's main features is to add members to the book club, add books to read or rate 
from google books api and get an overview of how each member has rated the different books. As previously mentioned, this is a demo, and the api key to 
google books api has been temporarily removed. I think this project would look a bit different if I would have built it now, especially the DTO-parts and unpacking of JSON objects,
but it reflects my eagerness to learn since it both includes the frontend and the backend parts. I also think it represents my interests a lot since these kind of application 
is very api dependent, and that is what I think is the most fun to build and maintain.

Some other projects
Link to golf buddies app, previously mentioned
https://github.com/robinalfengard/golfbuddies/tree/master/golfbuddies-api
This application was the examination work on Academy and was developed as a group with four other students. The backend is built with java and spring boot and the frontend
is built with React. The main features of the application is to connect golfers with other golfers based on their location and handicap. 

Link to Record Collector
https://github.com/robinalfengard/RecordCollector2.0
This application was made together with a front end student from Academy, so on this project I only worked with the backend. The backend is build with java and spring boot
connected to a postgresql database. The main feature for the application is to allow users to use the spotify api to save analog records to their profile. This should
help record collectors to keep track of which records they currently own when they are out shopping for more records.
