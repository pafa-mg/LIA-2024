# MobilityGuard Internship application

Welcome to apply for our 2024 internships at [MobilityGuard](https://www.mobilityguard.com/) in [Partille, Sweden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ueid4Dx8fDFy7eCq6).

## About MobilityGuard
MobilityGuard was founded over 21 years ago by our CEO Johan Sundström and his then businesspartner. 

Our first and most successful product is [OneGate](https://www.mobilityguard.com/products/onegate/) which is an access management solution used by most municipalities and many government agencies in Sweden. We also work with Försvarsmakten and other important actors in Sweden.

Every Swede is actually using our product without knowing it, for example when you login to do your tax declaration at [Skatteverket](https://skatteverket.se/), or if you register your pet cat at [Jordbruksverket](https://jordbruksverket.se/). Check the url and you will see `mg-local`, mg = MobilityGuard.

Our latest product is [WizePass](https://wizepass.com/) which is an electronic identification solution, similar to BankId but much more powerful. 

WizePass was originally made to solve our Swedish customers' identification problem proposed by changing the national exams in middle school to be 100% digital. Schools across Sweden now need to find an electronic identification solution which is not tied specifically to your personnummer and private person, but rather to your school account. WizePass solves this as well as other things that BankId can not do. 

For example, using WizePass let's you have multiple passes on the same or different devices; meaning you could have one pass for personal use and one for work on the same device. This also means that if you have a shared device at work, all users could have their own secure personal pass in the device which let's them authenticate and access only their own services without having to use their private BankId. 

You can check out our WizePass app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wizepass&hl=en_US&pli=1) and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/wizepass/id1660064425).

Right now MobilityGuard is expanding internationally with interested parties all over the world. We are in the process of signing a contract with a major IT firm in Sri Lanka, and we are in talks with multiple Ambassadors in Stockholm about using WizePass as their national electronic ID solution. It's all very exciting and it means we need all the help we can get, that's where hopefully you comes in!

## What are we looking for?
1. **Java** System Developers, preferably fullstack.
2. **JavaScript** & **Frontend** developers
3. **IT Project leaders** (small demand)

## What internship periods?
Currently open for all periods, no real limit. Though availability around summer holidays is limited.

## What will our interns do?
Both OneGate and WizePass use Java as their backend. OneGate, being over 20 years old, is as you might expect a so-called "monolith"-application using Java 11 LTS. WizePass uses the Quarkus framwork, maven and modern microservices architecture with Java 17 LTS.

**Interns** will mainly work on **WizePass**. 

**Backend** interns on the multiple APIs, adding and refactoring endpoints and solutions as needed. 

**Frontend** interns will work on the Enrolment interface and Admin interface connected with WizePass. These interfaces uses Vite with React, and either Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS libraries. The enrolment interface is what our customers use to issue a user a new WizePass. The Admin interface is what we use to set up the microservices and all connected entities, and will later be used by our customers to admin their enrolment interfaces and other customer owned services.

**OneGate** also needs some love, **backend** interns will help with simple refactors in specific parts of the monolith as well as create APIs in preparation for refactoring the control center GUI connected to OneGate, now generated with PHP. This control center GUI is something our **frontend** interns will be able to help us recreate with React or similar frameworks. Making the GUI go from fancy 1990s-PHP-look to a more modern easier-to-use look.

**IT Project leader** interns are a new addition for us, and our hope is that this intern will be able to help us with our application process for [DIGG](https://www.digg.se/) certification which is a major milestone towards solving the national exam digitalization problem. If this certification can be secured there is also a substantial cash bonus being promised by our CEO. We could also discuss doing scrum master work and similar in our WizePass and OneGate teams. We hope to discuss this with those interested during interviews to find a good solution.

## What does work at MobilityGuard look like?
Our office is in the old Partille train station buildings, all of which our CEO owns. This beautiful landmark (k-märkt) building has high ceilings, old wooden floors, and easy access to both train (being the train station) and bus connections from Gothenburg and the commuter train from Alingsås.

We use the Agile methodology with two week sprints, daily stand-ups in the mornings, and an Agile project board located in GitHub, integrated with GitHub issues and pull requests. It works well, and the team is very close and works tightly together. We prefer our interns spending as much time as possible in the office to get the help and support they need, but if you live far away or similar it's possible to work from home at least some of the week.

The Partille office is our headquarters, but we have offices in Spain, Colombia and some other international locations. It is possible to work from Spain in the future, if this is of interest. There are 8 full time developers, 2 support, 3 account managers, 2 groundskeepers, the CEO Johan Sundström and the financial manager here in the office, and we have a lot of fun going on conferances, trips and AWs togther. Every Tuesday we play floor ball (innebandy) here in a local school that the company pays for. We have a good time!
