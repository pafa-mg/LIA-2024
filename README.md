# MobilityGuard Internship application

Welcome to apply for our 2024 internships at [MobilityGuard](https://www.mobilityguard.com/) in [Partille, Sweden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ueid4Dx8fDFy7eCq6).

## About MobilityGuard
MobilityGuard was founded over 21 years ago by our CEO Johan Sundström and his then businesspartner. 

Our first and most successful product is [OneGate](https://www.mobilityguard.com/products/onegate/) which is an access management solution used by most municipalities and many government agencies in Sweden. We also work with Försvarsmakten and other important actors in Sweden.

Every Swede is actually using our product without knowing it, for example when you login to do your tax declaration at [Skatteverket](https://skatteverket.se/), or if you register your pet cat at [Jordbruksverket](https://jordbruksverket.se/). Check the url and you will see `mg-local`, mg = MobilityGuard. 

Our latest product is [WizePass](https://wizepass.com/) which is an electronic identification solution, similar to BankId but much more powerful. 

WizePass was originally made to solve our Swedish customers' identification problem proposed by changing the national exams in middle school to be 100% digital. Schools across Sweden now need to find an electronic identification solution which is not tied specifically to your personnummer and private person, but rather to your school account. WizePass solves this as well as other things that BankId can not do. 

For example, using WizePass let's you have multiple passes on the same or different devices; meaning you could have one pass for personal use and one for work on the same device. This also means that if you have a shared device at work, all users could have their own secure personal pass in the device which let's them authenticate and access only their own services without having to use their private BankId.

Right now MobilityGuard is expanding internationally with interested parties all over the world. We are in the process of signing a contract with major IT firms in Sri Lanka, and we are in talks with multiple Ambassadors in Stockholm about using WizePass as their national electronic ID solution. It's all very excited and it means we need all the help we can get, that's where hopefully you comes in!

## What are we looking for?
1. **Java** System Developers, preferably fullstack.
2. **JavaScript** & **Frontend** developers
3. **IT Project leaders** (small demand)
